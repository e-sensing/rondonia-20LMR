Description: This project contains a data cube to test ML/DL algorithms 
    for mapping tropical deforestation. It contains a data cube and a set of samples.
    The data cube is a regularized set of Sentinel-2 images for tile 20LMR, 
    covering a part of the Rondonia state in the Brazilian Amazonia. 
    The cube contains images from bands B02, B03, B04, B05, B07, 
    B8A, B08, B11, B12 from 2022-01-05 to 2022-12-23 in 16-day intervals.
    The samples contain time series for 792 selected locations which are assigned to 
    one of the classes "Clear_Cut_Bare_Soil", "Clear_Cut_Burned_Area", 
    "Mountainside_Forest", "Forest", "Riparian_Forest", 
    "Clear_Cut_Vegetation", "Water", "Wetland", and "Seasonally_Flooded". 
    This version requires sits 1.4.0.
